## Todo
- [ ] Add a cache system to avoid redundant database requests
- [ ] Add a traffic analysis system

## Why?
As an integrated service of Gravitalia, this allows users to share their links, while redirecting them securely.

Sites recognised by Gravitalia (such as YouTube, Spotify and many others) are exempt from the redirect confirmation page. However, lesser-known pages will ask the user to access them, and will specify the risk if it exists.
